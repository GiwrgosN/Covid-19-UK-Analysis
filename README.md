# Covid-19-UK-Analysis

For this analysis I used data from the UK government which has a portal with data about the Coronavirus in the UK; it contains data on
cases, deaths, and vaccinations on national and local levels. 
The portal is available on this page: https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk. 
We can acquire the data by querying its API.

This analysis envolves the specific parts:
1. Querying an open data API for public COVID information;
2. Molding this information into several dataframes;
3. Data transformations and plots to answer specific questions.
